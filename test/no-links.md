# Faking Jazz Together

Let me feel that way
Feeding time with interest
Love that's forced is borrowed
Eating out for breakfast

Will we last the fortnight?
Making plans forever
Can we last the night?
Faking jazz together

Reading out the tiles
With a tight whisper
Leads me to believe
Faking jazz together

Three tone as you go
Quadropus is deep below
Pining for some oxygen and friends...
